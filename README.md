  ```
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install nodejs
    $ sudo apt-get install npm

  ```

- Download the project at the 'Clone or download' tab.

- Unzip the project

  - If you prefer to clone the project in your computer, open a terminal and paste :
  
  ```
    git clone https://github.com/PassNum-Promo4/projetwebs3-amcossu.git
  ```
  
- In a terminal, go o the project directory

- As the backend application server is a NodeJS application, from the project root folder, you'll need to install the dependencies :

  ```
    cd server
    npm install
  ```

- To install the dependencies also in the frontend application, from the root project folder, you'll need :

  ```
    cd angApp
    npm install
  ```
- To run the server, go to the server directory and run :

  ```
    node server
  ```

- To open the application, go to angApp directory and run :

  ```
    ng serve --open
  ```
- You'll have your default browser that will open the application.
